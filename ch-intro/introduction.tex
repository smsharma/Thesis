\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the major unsolved problems in physics. Originally inferred through its gravitational influence on galaxies and clusters, a rich body of evidence has accumulated over the last four decades firmly establishing its existence. All of the evidence, however, comes from inferring dark matter's presence through its gravitational effects. Much else about it remains an open question: Does dark matter consist  of a fundamental particle? What is its mass? Could there be an entire dark sector, akin to the Standard Model (SM)? How does dark matter interact with the SM? Answering these questions represents a giant ongoing effort that draws from a rich body of theoretical and experimental work, as well as major input from the computational and numerical side. Fortunately, we are at the dawn of a data-driven era in astrophysics and cosmology -- a large number of ongoing and forthcoming experiments, both in the lab and in the sky, as well as increasingly open approach to data availability present great potential in elucidating the nature of dark matter. 

Dark matter plays a central role in many subfields of particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Understanding its nature and interactions would have far reaching consequences, as there is no concrete explanation within the frameworks of the Standard Models of particle physics. It would represent a paradigm shift in those fields and provide major insights into fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as elucidate the evolution of our Universe and the formation of structures within it. 

% While there exists a proliferation of ideas regarding the particle nature of dark matter, the dominant paradigm over the last three decades has been that of the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), which posits dark matter to consist of a particle with weak-scale interactions with the Standard Model, produced through thermal freeze-out in the early universe. This framework dovetails well, for example, with supersymmetric extensions to the Standard Model where candidates for dark matter can emerge naturally. After briefly describing alternative explanations, in this thesis I will focus exclusively on WIMP searches. I will also focus exclusively on astrophysical searches for WIMPs.

This chapter is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:evidence} I will summarize the large body of evidence pointing to the existence of dark matter. In Sec.~\ref{sec:particledm} I will describe possible explanations for the particle nature of dark matter and various detection paradigms, focusing on Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Section~\ref{sec:astrodm} will focus on the astrophysical effort to detect and characterize the nature of DM, in particular using gamma-ray data. I will briefly summarize the theoretical and experimental tools available to us in indirect detection searches. Finally, in Sec.~\ref{sec:summary} I will describe the organization of the rest of this thesis. % Wherever possible, I will touch upon the historical developments that have paved the way for our current state of understanding of dark matter and our efforts to look for it.

\section{Evidence for Dark Matter}
\label{sec:evidence}

Although the study of dark matter had its inception and development in the 20th century, the interplay between theory and observation in making the unknown knowable goes back much earlier. For example, the Aristotelian view of an immutable Universe with the Earth as its center offered a clean framework that did not call for additional invisible matter or celestial objects, and was the orthodox viewpoint until Renaissance astronomers conclusively refuted it with observations. Galileo, in the face of significant resistance from the Catholic Church, arguably played the largest role in this and discovered much that was previous unknowable -- including understanding the make-up of the Milky Way as consisting of individual stars rather than nebulous clouds, and observing Saturn's rings and Jupiter's four largest moons. These observations are very much in the spirit of modern dark matter searches -- demonstrating that the Universe can contain invisible forms of matter, and that scientific inquiry and technological developments can play a big role in revealing it to us.

% \subsection{Dynamical Evidence}

Evidence for some yet-unknown form of matter started piling up in the early 19th century. Lord Kelvin introduced the idea of applying the ``theory of gases'' to the Milky Way, describing stars as gas particles acting under the influence of gravity and in the process wondered whether a large number of stars may actually be dark bodies. In 1922, Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn wrote down for the first time a predictive model for the distribution of matter in the Milky Way, describing the stars as particles in a virialized system. Kapteyn used this method to obtain the local matter density in term of the the observed stellar mass, diving out the gravitational mass by the number of stars observed, extrapolating the stellar luminosity function down below that observed. Kapteyn's student Jan Oort as well as several others during this time, including Jeans, Lindblad and Opik were able to derive estimates for the density of matter in the local neighborhood, usually claiming that an excess above the observed luminous mass could be accounted for by the extrapolation of the stellar luminosity function down to very faint stars.

In 1933, Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky studied redshift data for galaxy clusters collected by Hubble and Humason, noticing large velocity dispersions in eight galaxies within the Coma cluster and applying the virial theorem to estimate its mass. Zwicky predicted the dispersion by using the number of observed galaxies, average mass of a galaxy and its extent, finding a value closer to 80 km\,s$^{-1}$. This was in stark conflict with the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 1000 km\,s$^{-1}$. From this, Zwicky concluded that ``If this would be confirmed, we would get the surprising result that dark matter is present in much greater amount than luminous matter''. In subsequent work, Zwicky was able to refine his estimates, confirming a very high mass-to-light ratio in the Coma cluster. An analysis of the Virgo cluster by Sinclair Smith in 1936 again pointed to a very high mass-to-light ratio in that system. In both cases, the astronomers put forward potential explanations in terms of ``clouds of low-luminosity internebular material''

Although this represented a conundrum, there was widespread consensus that more information would be needed to understand what was going on. Historically, velocity rotation curves---the circular velocity profiles of stars in a galaxy as a function of the distance from the galactic center---did the most to convince the scientific community to the existence of large amounts of non-luminous matter in galaxies. The idea here is as follows. Standard Newtonian theory dictates that the circular velocity of stars is given by $v_c(r) = \sqrt{GM/r}$, where $r$ is the radial distance, $M$ the enclosed mass and $G$ the universal gravitational constant. In the region beyond the galactic disk (defining the observed extent of the galaxy), we expect the enclosed mass to be constant, and Gauss' law dictates that the circular velocity fall as $v_c \propto r^{-1/2}$. The detection of the 21-cm emission line in 1950s heralded a new era in radio astronomy and enabled the accurate measurement of rotation curves. Measurements throughout the 1970s, starting with those of the nearby galaxies M31 and M33 and indeed our own Milky Way, pointed to the approximate flattening out of rotation curves at larger radii contrary to above expectation, and implications for the missing mass problem were realized soon after. This implied that the mass continues to increase as $M \propto r$, pointing to the existence of additional unobserved `dark' mass beyond the visible component. From this, the density of dark matter can be inferred to roughly scale as $\rho(r) \propto 1/r^2$. A large number of observations on galactic and cluster scales since then have strengthened the case for the existence of halos of dark matter extending far beyond the visible extent of these objects. In the left panel of Fig., I show the measured rotation curves for the Milky Way, and expectation from a disk-like component inferred from baryonic matter, as well as an additional dark matter component. It can clearly be seen that the additional component is required to match the observed rotation curves [describe plot].

Cosmology provides substantial evidence supporting the existence of dark matter in our Universe. $\Lambda$CDM, often referred to as the standard model of cosmology, is associated with the presence of dark energy ($\Lambda$) and cold dark matter (CDM), is able to account for a plethora of cosmological observations, including the existence and structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure distribution of matter, accelerating expansion of the Universe and relic elemental abundances. The CMB, which represents the imprint of photons that decoupled from the baryon-photon fluid about 370,000 years ago and have been free-streaming ever since, by itself provides irrefutable evidence for dark matter. The primary relevant observable is the angular scale of inhomogeneities in the temperature distribution of the CMB -- the $TT$ angular power spectrum. The spectrum largely consists of a set of peaks, each peak giving us an angular scale with a particularly significant contributions to the temperature fluctuations. The leading physical effect behind these are acoustic oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid during photon decoupling. Early on, photons and baryons were electromagnetically coupled, and non-baryonic dark matter was responsible for generating gravitational potential wells that could pull in the baryon-photon fluid. The photon pressure acting against these wells gives rise to a tower of modes, imprinted in the CMB as the acoustic peaks. While the detailed physics is somewhat nuanced (see [Wayne Hu's tutorials] for an introduction), the relative heights of these peaks can provide information about the energy content of our Universe, including the relative composition of baryonic and non-baryonic (dark) matter. Very heuristically, the position of the first peak provides information about the curvature of the universe (and hence how much total ``stuff'' there is in it), while the second peaks tells us how much of the matter is baryonic (ordinary matter). The third peak can shed insights into the abundance of non-baryonic dark matter. Historically, the WMAP satellite, while not able to fully resolve the third peak, was already able to say that dark matter makes up the majority of the matter budget in the Universe, finding.... Since then, Planck has been able to pin down.... The right panel of Fig. shows the Planck $TT$ spectrum, along with the theoretical predictions.

The above is by no means exhaustive -- observations over a large range of scales provide further evidence for the existence of (non-baryonic) dark matter, including observations of the distribution of galaxies on large scales, strong lensing, and observations of merging clusters.

\section{(Particle) Nature of Dark Matter}
\label{sec:particledm}

Although the existence of dark matter is incontrovertible, its nature largely remains a mystery. These days, it is often implicitly assumed that when people are talking about detecting dark matter, say at a Xenon direct detection experiment or in gamma ray data, that this refers to a dark matter \emph{particle}. As touched upon above, this has by no means always been the case -- early usage and references to dark matter usually referred to the existence of generic dark objects that would be too faint to be observed, such as dim stars or internebular material. The transition in usage from an adjective to a noun was a result of sociological changes within the particle physics and astrophysics communities, bringing the two closer after the missing mass problem had been firmly accepted in the 1970s. All evidence amassed since then is consistent with dark matter being a fundamental particle, or even the existence of an entire dark sector consisting of many particles with a rich set of properties and interactions.

Within the Standard Model, neutrinos---by virtue of being stable (or very long-lived), electrically neutral particles that do not interacting strongly---contain some of the essential attributes for a particle dark matter candidate, and were discussed in this context early on. Cosmological effects of neutrinos were discussed throughout the 1960s and 1970s, pioneered by the work of Zeldovich and others, and their implication for the missing mass observed on (super-)galactic scales was discussed by Weinberg and others in the the late 1970s. Early simulations during the 1980s eventually showed that hot (relativistic) and cold (non-relativistic) particle dark matter would lead to very different outcomes for structure formation, leading to formation and collapse of larger structures---``top-down''---in the former case and a hierarchical ``bottom-up'' structure formation, where overdensities seed larger structures, in the latter. Neutrinos, by virtue of being very light thermal relics, would be extremely relativistic during structure formation and, combined with these simulations early surveys of the local Universe were able to quickly disfavor their role as dark matter candidates. Nevertheless, along the way neutrinos served as a gateway particle in understanding the implications of new particles to observations on galactic, cluster and cosmological scales.

With no reason to be confined to the Standard Model, supersymmetry (SUSY) posits that nature may contain a spacetime symmetry relating bosons and fermions, requiring that for ever boson a fermion with the same quantum numbers must exist (and vice versa). This leads to the prediction of several new electrically neutral particles that are uncharged under the strong force. If some of these were stable, they could have played an important role in the history of our Universe and could conceivably make up (some portion of) dark matter. Supersymmetry took its modern form with a paper by Dimopolous and Georgi, who introduced the MSSM. Here, superpartners of the $Z$ boson, photon and two Higgses mix to form four particles, today known as neutralinos. $R$-parity conservation would prevent the lightest neutralino from decaying quickly after being created. Neutralinos have arguably been the most-discussed dark matter candidate, in part because supersymmetry--with its ability to enable gauge coupling unification and solve the electroweak hierarchy problem---is motivated in its own right independent of the dark matter problem, and the existence of a viable DM candidate is often seen as a desirable bonus.

Besides SUSY-motivated particles such as neutralinos, there is no shortage of viable particle DM candidates today, including but not limited to axions, sterile neutrinos and dark photons. The most general constraints on the properties of particle DM, \emph{e.g.} its mass, are relatively mild. In particular, observations $m_\text{scalar} \gtrsim 10^{-22}$\,eV for bosons, and $m_\text{fermion} \gtrsim 0.7$\,keV for fermions. This is obtained from observations of DM halos around dwarf galaxies, imposing the requirement for particles to occupy a minimum phase-space volume according to the uncertainty principle for bosons and the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions.

\subsection{Thermal Dark Matter}

There are several general and striking features pertaining to dark matter particles in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model in the early Universe. In order for such a particle to freeze out of equilibrium and become a cold relic, it must be heavier that $\sim$keV mass. Additionally, in order to match the observed DM density, the DM particles must self-annihilate with a cross-section of $\sigma v\sim 10^{-26}$\,cm$^3$\,s$^{-1}$, which is strikingly close to the cross-section arising from the weak interaction. This fact holds for a large variety of electroweak-scale DM candidates, and combined with the theoretical arguments for the existence of new physics at electroweak scales these particles, known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) have become the dominant particle dark matter paradigm and have motivated an extensive search program.

Searches for WIMPs are generally organized into three categories depending on the experimental detection paradigm. Direct detection, which looks for the energy deposited when dark matter particles recoil against a nucleus through the process $\text{SM}\,\chi\rightarrow\text{SM}\,\chi$, where $\chi$ is a DM particle. While the flux of WIMPs through a terrestrial detector can be large, the expected deposited energies and interaction rates would be very small, requiring large amounts of target material and exquisite control over backgrounds. Direct detection experiments have been able to set very strong limits on WIMP scenarios and have been able to exclude several attractive baseline models, such as $Z$-mediated DM interactions--see~\cite{} for a recent review. The second class of searches involves production of WIMPs at particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) through the process $\mathrm{SM}\,\mathrm{SM}\rightarrow\chi\,\chi$, usually in association with additionally visible particles emitted by initial or intermediate SM particles that can used to detect the event along with the missing energy characterizing the WIMP. 

The final strategy and the focus of this thesis is indirect detection, which looks for the annihilation of DM particles into SM particles through the process $\chi\,\chi\rightarrow\mathrm{SM}\,\mathrm{SM}$ by looking for its signature in astrophysical data. The nature of the SM particles depends on the specific DM model. The basic idea behind indirect detection is that annihilation processes will be taking place at higher rates in regions of the Universe that have more dark matter, leading to an excess in production of SM particles from those regions which would then cascade on to photons, electrons, positrons and (anti)protons, some of which could eventually reach us and be detected with telescopes. %In the next section, I will introduce some of the challenges associated with indirect detection searches and tools required to perform them. 

\section{Indirect Detection of Annihilating Dark Matter}
\label{sec:astrodm}

As noted above, for generic thermal WIMP scenarios where the DM can self-annihilate, its late-time abundance is set by the coupling of the DM particle to the Standard Model. The expected self-annihilation cross-section in this case is entirely predictive and we would expect an electroweak-scale cross-section around $\sigma v\sim 10^{-26}$\,cm$^3$\,s$^{-1}$, and a particle mass of $\mathcal O($GeV-TeV). DM particles in this mass range annihilating to SM particles would produce secondary photons which would fall dominantly in the gamma-ray range. This regime is well-probed by today's gamma-ray telescopes, including the \emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope, as well as several current and upcoming observatories. % In this section, I will describe the ingredients necessary to calculate the expected DM annihilation flux and discuss common astrophysical search targets. 

\subsection{Tools for Indirect Detection}

A primary challenge for indirect detection searches is to calculate the annihilation flux that would be observed from a given astrophysical target or source population. The basic prescription for doing so is as follows. If the DM particle number density at angular coordinates $\psi$ (describing the angle away from the Galactic plane) located at a line-of-sight distance $l$ from us is $n[r(l,\psi)]$ and the self-annihilation cross section is $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, the annihilation rate per particle is given by
\begin{equation}
n[r(l,\psi)]\langle\sigma v\rangle = \frac{\rho[r(l,\psi)]}{m_\chi}\langle\sigma v\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $\rho[r(l,\psi)]$ is the DM density and $m_\chi$ its particle mass. The total annihilation rate in a volume element $dV = l^2\,dl\,d\Omega$ is given by convolving this quantity by the number of particles in the volume:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\rho[r(l,\psi)]}{m_\chi}\langle\sigma v\rangle \frac{\rho[r(l,\psi)]}{2m_\chi}dV.
\end{equation}
where the factor of $2$ in the denominator is to avoid double counting since two particles are involved in the annihilation process. The total observed annihilation flux is obtained by integrating along the line of sight and over a given angular extent:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Phi}{dE}(E,\Psi) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int\,d\Omega\,dl\,\rho[r(l,\psi)]^2\frac{\langle\sigma v\rangle}{2m_\chi^2}\frac{dN}{dE}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{dN}{dE}$ gives the number of photons produced per annihilation, for a given annihilation channel. The annihilation cross-section can often be factorized out of the integral, but this is not possible if the cross section has a strong velocity-dependence, e.g. in $p$-wave annihilation scenarios (see for more details). %All astrophysical information is contained in the so-called $J$-factor, which is the line-of-sight integral along a given direction of the squared dark matter density. 
In the simplest scenarios where this is possible, the annihilation flux factorizes as
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\Phi}{dE}(E,\Psi) = \underbrace{\frac{\langle\sigma v\rangle}{8\pi m_\chi^2}\frac{dN}{dE}}_{d\Phi_\mathrm{PP}/dE}\underbrace{\int\,d\Omega\,dl\,\rho[r(l,\psi)]^2}_J
\end{equation}
where $d\Phi_\mathrm{PP}/dE$ encapsulates the particle physics assumptions, and $J\equiv\int\,d\Omega\,dl\,\rho[r(l,\psi)]^2$ is the so-called $J$-factor and captures the astrophysical dependence of the flux. Objects with higher $J$-factors over some localized regions typically make for more interesting indirect detection targets. However, a high $J$-factor by itself does not guarantee a good annihilation target -- this must additionally be balanced with how well the systematic uncertainties on both the properties of the potential signal as well as astrophysical backgrounds and Galactic foregrounds can be accounted for and controlled.

\subsection{Sources of Gamma Rays from Annihilating Dark Matter}

An important challenge in indirect detection is to accurately characterize the DM signal and associated uncertainties. This often involves astrophysical input as well as input from observations at other wavelengths and $N$-body simulations. Given the typically sizable systematic uncertainties, it is crucial to have the ability to probe the same DM parameter space with multiple complementary targets. The following targets are generally used in DM annihilation searches:  %Roughly, the $J$-factor scales as $\sim(\int\rho^2\,dV)/d^2$, where $\rho$ is the DM density distribution and $d$ the distance of the object from us. The following objects are generally considered as targets in DM annihilation searches: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Dwarf galaxies}: Being dark matter dominated and having relatively low expected astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) of the Milky Way have traditionally been considered excellent targets for DM annihilation searches. There have been about 45 dSphs candidates discovered recently by surveys like SDSS and DES, and searches for gamma-ray emission from these have been able to place strong constraints on annihilation scenarios, constraining thermal WIMPs below $\lesssim 70$~GeV at 95\% confidence level for the case of annihilation into  the $b\bar b$ final state. The relevant $J$-factors are far from well-characterized, however -- assumptions about, \emph{e.g.}, the dSph halo shape and membership criteria for stars used to infer the halo properties can lead to large uncertainties.
\item \emph{The Milky Way halo}: Our own Galaxy is the brightest source of DM emission in the sky. Searches in the inner Galaxy, where the signal is expected to be the brightest, have yielded an excess emission whose spatial and spectral properties can be consistent with those of a DM annihilation signal (\emph{e.g.}, a $\sim$40\,GeV WIMP annihilation to $b\bar b$ with approximately thermal cross section), often called the Galactic Center Excess. This region of the sky is however complicated by the presence of substantial and difficult-to-characterize Galactic foregrounds which are difficult to characterize, which complicates the interpretation of any signal and/or constraint from this region. Indeed, recent results based on analyzing the statistics of photons in the region (see Chapter 2) indicate that the excess is more consistent with emission from an unresolved population of point sources rather than a dark matter signal, which is expected to be more diffuse in nature.

Another class of searches focuses on looking for DM emission from the Milky Way halo over larger regions of the sky at higher Galactic latitudes over, where the signal is still appreciable but Galactic foregrounds are much lower. These studies necessitate being able to accurately characterize the Galactic foreground emission over larger regions of the sky, and a careful consideration of these effect yields stringent limits, excluding thermal WIMPs at masses below $\lesssim 70$~GeV at 95\% confidence level for the case of annihilation into $b\bar b$.

\item \emph{Galactic substructure}: Hierarchical bottom-up structure formation necessitates the existence of substructure within galaxies, and subhalos have the potential to be attractive DM annihilation targets. Unlike classical and ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, low-mass subhalos with virial mass $M_\mathrm{vir}\lesssim 10^8$\,M$_\odot$ would be mostly dark with highly suppressed stellar activity, which makes it difficult to localize them and look for their gamma-ray emission. Traditional searches rely on attempting to characterize the emission from unassociated gamma-ray sources detected by \emph{Fermi} as potentially coming from DM annihilation in individual subhalos, and comparing these observations to expectations from $N$-body simulations.

An orthogonal approach is to study the statistics of photons associated with DM annihilation from a population of dim subhalos. These subhalos may not be detectable individually, but their collective emission could show up as a heightened level of ``clumpiness'' in the photon map. Statistical methods described in Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis can be used to look for this structure in gamma-ray data, and this application is currently a subject of ongoing study.

\item \emph{Extragalactic galaxies and clusters}: Searches for DM annihilation in extragalactic targets have traditionally been complicated by the difficulty in characterizing the DM properties of extragalactic halos and the presence of potentially significant astrophysical emission. Searches for emission from individual, nearby clusters, the integrated, isotropic emission from background halos, and cross-correlation of gamma rays with local catalogs of galaxies and large-scale structure. These searches typically do not attain sensitivity to thermal WIMPs for realistic astrophysical assumptions. Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis focus on developing methods to systematically characterize the dark matter emission from a large number of extragalactic galaxies and clusters along with the associated uncertainties. Looking for this structure in gamma-ray data is able to place stringent limits on annihilating DM, excluding thermal WIMPs at masses below $\lesssim 40$~GeV at 95\% confidence level for the case of annihilation into $b\bar b$.
